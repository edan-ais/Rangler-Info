## Patent Notice
The Rangler technology is patent-pending under provisional application number [APPLICATION NUMBER] filed with [PATENT OFFICE] on [FILING DATE].

This repository provides a demonstration implementation with limited usage rights ONLY. This code is NOT available for commercial use, modification, or redistribution without explicit licensing permission.

## What is Rangler?
Traditional data analytics AI tools function essentially as "ChatGPT with graphs" - generating one-time visualizations that rarely provide ongoing value. Rangler takes a fundamentally different approach. Data analysts know that executives don't want another graph to look at; they want to be notified when something is wrong or could be improved. Rangler handles this by consistently tracking your data over time and sending notifications when action is needed - similar to how RocketMoney monitors financial activity, you don't need to log in to be told that your account is low or that you've spent $4,000 that month, it just tells you when you need to know. We automate the most valuable part of data analysis: identifying which questions the business should be asking in the first place.

# Technical Architecture
## Core Technology Stack
At Rangler's core is the SQL Intelligence and Modeling Support (SIMS) Agent, a five-module framework that includes continuous intent monitoring, structured dialogue process flows, generative artificial intelligence, natural language understanding, and reusable query templates. This architecture eliminates the need for database expertise, time-intensive knowledge base setup, or understanding of underlying data structures. In rigorous testing across 350+ unique queries and 155 test participants, SIMS achieved 91.3% accuracy regardless of user technical expertise while reducing query processing time by 99.7% compared to traditional approaches.

## Key Features and User Benefits
Rangler's process begins with a tracking command (e.g., "Track new hire onboarding, daily refresh cadence") and automatically breaks it into the comprehensive business questions it represents: monthly new hire volume, average onboarding duration, process bottlenecks, and deadline compliance. The system generates relevant visualizations for all these metrics, allowing users to add specific tracking parameters at any time. Rangler maintains ongoing analysis of data patterns and proactively notifies users of actionable insights, anomalies, or opportunities without requiring constant dashboard monitoring. Rangler achieves industry-leading performance with complex queries averaging a 7.2-second response completion time and comprehensive data translation completed within 17 seconds, even for advanced forecasting operations. The system combines turn-based conversation, dynamic data visualization, and query complexity scoring to translate raw data into actionable insights and context-relevant recommendations.


## Future Development
Future enhancements will focus on expanding Rangler's notification capabilities, integration with additional data sources, and development of domain-specific intelligence modules for specialized business functions. Our vision is to make Rangler the standard for intelligent data monitoring across industries including finance, healthcare, retail, and manufacturing.

## System Requirements
For optimal performance, Rangler requires a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled and appropriate data source access credentials.
